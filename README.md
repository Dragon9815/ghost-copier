# ghost-copier
Factorio mod that copies attributes from a ghost when placed manually.

Inspired by [Katherine of Sky](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTIV3KbAvaGEyNjoMoNaGtQ) video where she complained about placing assemblers over ghosts not taking the recipe, and chests not taking the ghosts limits.
